# Carbon Black - ThreatConnect Connector

The ThreatConnect connector for Carbon Black Response is a simple python-daemon
communicats with ThreatConnect's API and retrieve Indicators of Compromise and 
formats them as a Threat Intel Feed for Carbon Black Response.

# Installing TC Agent (Centos/RHEL 6)

The TC agent must be installed on the same system as Cb Response.

* Create directories

	```
	mkdir -p /usr/share/cb/integrations/threatconnect
	```
	
* Download threatconnect Agent

	```
	wget -O /usr/share/cb/integrations/ https://github.com/carbonblack/cb-threatconnect-connector/releases/download/2.0.0/tc_agent
	```
	
* Download threatconnect Logo

	```
	wget -O /usr/share/cb/integrations/threatconnect/threatconnect-logo.png https://github.com/carbonblack/cb-threatconnect-connector/releases/download/2.0.0/threatconnect-logo.png
	```
	
* Create threatconnect Agent Config File


#### Sample TC Agent Config

	[general]
	#
	# CB Response configuration details.  This is used to create the feed in the CB Response UI automatically
	# feed_url should be the same file path as is used in out-file parameter for tc_agent
	#
	feed_url=file://tmp/threatconnect.json
	cb_server_url=https://192.168.1.42
	cb_server_token=
	cb_server_ssl_verify=False
	
	
	#
	# This section allows global configuration options to be passed to the ThreatConnect feed.
	# The API_KEY is an integer value and should not be enclosed in quotes.
	# Utilize the API and Secret keys provided by ThreatConnect to access your specific community.
	#
	
	#
	# Base URL for ThreatConnect
	#
	base_url=https://sandbox.threatconnect.com/api
	
	access_id=
	
	secret_key=
	
	#
	# The default organization to pull IOCs
	#
	default_org=Carbon Black
	
	#
	#
	#
	sources=Carbon Black
	
	#
	# This agent allows for the custom "CB Alert" type to be added to the Threat Connect feed.
	#
	ioc_types=CB Alert
	#
	# Maximum number of IOCs to put in feed.  CB Response has a limit to the number of threat reports in a feed for
	# for performance reasons.
	#
	max_iocs=10000

	
* copy and modify the above config to `/etc/cb/integrations/threatconnect/threatconnect_agent.conf`

#### Running threatconnect Agent Manually

	./tc_agent --config-file=/etc/cb/integrations/threatconnect/threatconnect_agent.conf --out-file /usr/share/cb/integrations/threatconnect/tc.json --log-file /var/log/cb/integrations/tc.log

#### Example Cron Entry

# Development Notes	

## threatconnect Agent Build Instructions (Centos 6)

### Install Dependencies

* zlib-devel
* openssl-devel
* sqlite-devel

### Install Python 3.6

	
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-shared LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath /usr/local/lib"
	make
	make altinstall


### Create VirtualEnv


	python3.6 -m venv venv-build
	source ./venv-build/bin/activate
	pip install -r requirements.txt


### Create Executable


	pyinstaller main.spec

Prepare a threatconnect.conf configuration file to setup the daemon, by following
the provided example and the configuration subsection below.

You can run the threatconnnect connector by executing main.py with python or by 
building the executable for your system using the instructions below.

`./tc_agent --config-file threatconnect.conf`

The agent will begin polling threat connect periodically.

## Configuration

The tc_agent is controlled by a simple conf file. 

There is an example threatconnect.example.conf provided in the git repository.

The `[general]` stanza of the provided .conf file should include the required
configuration paramters for accessing ThreatConnect - some of which are optional.

`base_url=<string>` controls the destination ThreatConnect endpoint

`secret_key=<string>` controls the secret key for ThreatConnect API access

`access_id=<string>` controls the acces id for ThreatConnect API access

`defaulg_org=<string>` controls the deafult org when filtering IOCS

`sources=comma,deliminted,list` controls the sources to query for, optional - 
defaults to all available

`ioc_min=<int>` controls the minimum IOC value to include, optional

`ioc_types=comma,delimited,list` controls the IOC Types to gather - defaults to 
'File,Address,Host' - optional

`custom_ioc_key` controls the custom IOC field/key to look for when using CUSTOM IOCS
Defaults to 'Query', optional


The following configuration options are for creating and presenting the 
Threat Inteligence Feed to CbR via REST API.

`cbapi_key=<string>` api key to use when access CBR api 

`cbapi_hostname=<string>` fqdn to use when accessing CBR

`cbapi_ssl_verify=<bool> True/False` used to control ssl validation for CBR API - defaults to TRUE

`feed_url` feed url to use when advertising the feed to CBR

The following are optinal misc options:
`niceness=<int>` controls os.nice of the daemon

`debug=<bool>` controls the debug logging of deamon set True/False

## PyInstaller and  Building the Agent as an Executable 
Use pip to install the project requirements like:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Use `pyinstaller main.spec`, the executable agent will be dist/tc_agent. 

Run the agent and pass --config-file to supply the path to the configuration file
